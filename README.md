# HardCoreData

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Krivoblotsky/HardCoreData.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Krivoblotsky/HardCoreData)

HardCoreData is a yet another core data stack based on Marcus Zarra's multithreading [approach](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/07/multi-context-coredata/). This smart approach uncouples the writing into its own private queue and keeps the UI smooth as button.

## Requirements

## Installation

HardCoreData is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
